Evolutionary Lifecycle is composed of a cyclic-shaped set of phases, as other 
lifecycle models seen previously. It works as a traditional Waterfall 
development cycle but split in smaller incremental models. As a result, the 
development team can either altering the requirements or planning modifications
on the product.

Some benefits:
-Reduces the risk and the cost, as you examine and analyze issues of each phase.
-Minimizes critical and serious defects during testing phase, and also reduces
the amount of late changes.
-Response to changes is quite improved.
-Team is more motivated and collaborating, and also the customer is involved in
the development.
-Marketing and sales teams can access to the product in earlier stages, so the
sales cycle can be started before the product release.
