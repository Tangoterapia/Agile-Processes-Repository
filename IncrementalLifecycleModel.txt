Incremental Lifecycle Model is a process of software development, in which the
software is developed in several steps. Each step has the same amount of phases,
but in each iteration, a new functionality is added to the system until the user
is satisfied with the resultant product. After the first iteration, the system is
put into production. It's usually a set of the basic requirements, and updates 
will be added after future iterations.

The phases of work are:
-Requirement Analysis: interaction with the client which outputs a set of requirements
and specifications for the system to be developed.
-Design: a plan on how to develop the application which meets the requirements is
prepared by the team.
-Code: actual coding of the software product.
-Test: if the test finds out the software works properly, it is deployed.
After all these steps are completed, we say we've finished the iteration. Then, another
meeting with the client will take place, and he will decide whether the product is
everything he needed, and therefore the project is finished, or if it needs any additional
functionality, which would mean a new iteration is going to be done.

Scenarios in which Incremental models are optimal:
-Requirements of the system are clearly understood
-There's a small amount of time to develop the product because an early release is
needed.
-High-risk features and goals are involved.

Advantages:
-Quick generation of the software.
-Flexible and less expensive to change requirements.
-During the development stage of the project, changes can be done to the product.
-Customers can respond to each building, so they are quite involved in the project.
-Errors are easily identified.

Disadvantages:
-Requires a good planning designing.
-As not all the requirements will be captured in the beginning and some of them might be
added in later iterations, this could generate problems in the system architecture, as
a conflict between what is had and what the customer now requires may arise.
-Iterations are rigid and separated.
-Rectifying a problem consumes a lot of time as it must be done in all units.
