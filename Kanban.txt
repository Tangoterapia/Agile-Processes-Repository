HISTORY
Kanban is an engineering process which was first developed by Toyota in the
late 1940s. It is a just-in-time process, that is, the production is directly
dependent on the client's demand. Instead of manufacturing a lot and then
trying to sell all those products, the quantity produced is the demanded by
the market. This is done to minimize the waste.
In Japanese, Kanban means "card with signs", and the system is called this way
because Toyota workers used this kanban to signal steps in the manufacturing
process: what was done, what was started but not done yet and what needed to
be done but wasn't started.
In the beginning of the 21st century, it was discovered that Kanban was actually
applicable to other working scenarios, not only the manufacturing industry, and
David J. Anderson effectively stated how this Kanban method needed to be applied.
